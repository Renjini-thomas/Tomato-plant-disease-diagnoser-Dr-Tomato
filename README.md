# 🍅Dr Toamto 🌿🤖
## AI-Powered Tomato Plant Disease Diagnoser

### Dr. Tomato is an intelligent deep learning–based web app that diagnoses tomato leaf diseases from uploaded images and provides organic and chemical treatment suggestions using a local LLM (phi-3 via Ollama).

### This web application detects tomato leaf diseases using transfer learning and ensemble deep learning models.
### It combines VGG19, ResNet50, and DenseNet121 as base learners with a Logistic Regression meta-learner, achieving up to 95.6% test accuracy on 22,000+ leaf images.
### To make it even smarter, it integrates a local Ollama LLM (phi-3) that gives AI-generated treatment advice, both organic and chemical, for the diagnosed disease.
